# UFOs

## The purpose of the project, the technologies used
In this UFO data set project we are utilizing a filter that is connected to HTML and Java Script functionalities. 

We first obtained the data from the UFO data in a js format which we then created a js function that would translate the data to a table format/ dataframe format. 

We also created a series of filters that would filter all of the information through a table in the html page. In order to achieve this we had to create two new functions, one to create a set of filters that would join together the filters and the values and another one that would run the dictionary utilizing the filters as a condition.

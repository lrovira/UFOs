# UFOs

In this UFO project set we are utilizing a filter that is connected to HTML and Java Script functionalities. 

We first obtained the data from the OVNI in a js. format which we then created a js formula that would translate the data to a table format/ data frame. 

We also created a series of filters that would filter all of the information through a table in the html page. In order to achieve this we had to create two new formats, one that would join together the filters and the values and another one that would run the dictionary utilizing the filters as a condition.
